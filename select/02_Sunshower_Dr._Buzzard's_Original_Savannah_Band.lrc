[00:39.78] Sunshower, just a sign of the power
[00:44.25] Of loving you, oh, baby
[00:47.85] Sunshower, got me by the hour
[00:53.27] Wanting you, oh, baby
[01:03.77] 
[00:56.82] When my eyes went out to you
[01:00.41] I made up my mind
[01:04.01] That every little thing I do
[01:08.55] Be designed to glorify you
[01:21.55] 
[01:13.16] Ooh, my whole life through
[01:17.62] I've been walking in the rain
[01:21.22] Until that day, I chanced on you
[01:24.83] And the sun came pouring down too
[01:41.33] 
[01:29.31] Sunshower, just a sign of the power
[01:32.97] Of loving you, oh, baby
[01:37.42] Sunshower, got me by the hour
[01:41.13] Wanting you, oh, baby
[01:51.63] 
[01:44.73] Ooh, a passing word from you
[01:49.28] Makes my day worthwhile
[01:52.85] It takes all of my deadened dooms
[01:57.49] On a ride to a faraway moon
[02:10.99] 
[02:01.94] On the dark and troubled sea
[02:05.59] You gave me the light
[02:09.17] And now I'm sailing so fast and free
[02:12.78] Leaving stormy skies behind me
[02:27.78] 
[02:18.38] Sunshower, just a sign of the power
[02:21.00] Of loving you, oh, baby
[02:25.53] Sunshower, got me by the hour
[02:29.17] Wanting you, oh, baby
[02:39.67] 
[02:33.66] Sunshower, just a sign of the power
[02:37.26] Of loving you, oh, baby
[02:41.81] Sunshower, got me by the hour
[02:46.34] Wanting you, oh, baby
[02:56.84] 
[02:49.92] Sunshower, just a sign of the power
[02:53.87] Of loving you, oh, baby
[02:57.41] Sunshower, got me by the hour
[03:03.85] Wanting you, oh, baby
[03:14.35] 
[03:05.68] Sunshower, just a sign of the power
[03:10.23] Of loving you, oh, baby
[03:13.89] Sunshower, got me by the hour
[03:17.45] Wanting you, oh, baby
[03:27.95] 
[03:21.16] Sunshower, just a sign of the power
[03:26.61] Of loving you
[03:28.48] Sunshower, got me by the hour
[03:31.17] Wanting you
[03:36.67] 
[03:32.99] Sunshower, just a sign of the power
[03:33.81] Of loving you
[03:38.30] Sunshower, got me by the hour
[03:42.82] Wanting you
